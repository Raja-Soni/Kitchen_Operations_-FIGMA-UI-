This project is a complete **Figma to Flutter UI conversion** that I truly enjoyed building!  
Throughout this journey, I learned a lot about **Flutter layouts, widget composition, reusable UI design**, and **state management**.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Converting detailed **Figma designs** into responsive and pixel-perfect Flutter layouts  
- Building **custom widgets**, where each small part of every page is modular and customizable  
- Structuring UI so that updates in one widget **don’t affect the entire page**  
- Managing app state using both **BLoC** and **setState** to handle different use cases efficiently  
- Writing clean, reusable, and scalable Flutter code  

## ⚙️ Features
- Multiple **screens/pages** built from scratch  
- Functional **TabBar** and **BottomNavigationBar**  
- Smooth scrolling using **SingleChildScrollView**  
- Modular and **customizable UI components**  
- Combination of **BLoC** and **setState** for flexible state management  
- Organized and maintainable **project structure**

## 💡 Summary
This project helped me understand how to translate **Figma designs into real Flutter UIs**, while keeping the architecture clean and modular.  
It strengthened my skills in **Flutter UI/UX development**, **state management**, and **component-based architecture**.  

I truly enjoyed this learning experience and look forward to building more creative Flutter projects! 🚀
